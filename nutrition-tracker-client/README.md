# 🍽️ Nutrition Tracker – Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Nutrition Tracker web app. It allows users to search for foods, log meals, and track nutrition over time. This project is an ongoing personal learning effort to strengthen my skills in React, component-based architecture, and front-end state management.

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

I'm currently prioritizing core functionality over styling. New features and UI improvements are being added iteratively as I continue learning.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Build responsive components using React and JSX
- Implement state management with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Integrate with a RESTful API (built in ASP.NET Core)
